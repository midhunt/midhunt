- ðŸ“– I'm currently reading ["Design Pattern for Machine Learning" by Valliappa Lakshmanan, Sara Robinson, et al.](https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Design-Patterns-Preparation/dp/1098115783)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Data Science and Machine Learning projects
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for opportunities such as Data Scientist, Data Engineer or Machine Learning Engineer in the U.S
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Engineering, Metadata Management, Data Architecture, MLOps, etc.
